# `tab-organizer`

- Small and silly extension to group tabs by domain
- Created in 15 minutes to organize my 100+ tabs in 5 opened Chrome windows
- And then recreated in a few hours of studying [Plasmo framework](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework)
- Why didn't I just close/sort my tabs manually? _Because._
